## CTI Runtime Components HDRP 7.2.

In case you want to use the CTI shaders along with the HDRP 7.2.+ and Shader Graph you have to import the "CTI Runtime Components HDRP 7.2" package that will come with Shader graph shaders for HDRP.
Please note that Shader Graph will not fully support LOD cross fading when it comes to shadow casting billoards. So the fully working version of this is inside the "CTI_HDRP_HLSL_7.2" package.
