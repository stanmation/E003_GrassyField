## CTI HDRP 10.3.2 and above Shader Graph package

This package contains the CTI HDRP runtime components (shaders) for HDRP 10.3.2 and above. Bark and leave shaders have been ported back to Shader Graph (which now supports all features) so they should also support higher version of HDRP than just 10.3.2.
The Billboard shader still uses HLSL and might break in higher version. If so please let me know.
