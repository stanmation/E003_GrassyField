## CTI Runtime Components URP

In case you want to use CTI shaders along with the URP you have to import the "CTI Runtime Components URP" package that will come with shaders for URP and further details in the "Custom Tree Importer 3.0 URP" PDF.
Please note that when using URP only basic CTI LOD shaders are supported.

The shaders have been tested with URP 7.3.1.

Higher versions of URP needs you to import the "CTI_URP_10.3.2_RuntimeComponents", the "CTI_URP_11.0_RuntimeComponents" or the "CTI_URP_12.0_b9_RuntimeComponents" as well.
